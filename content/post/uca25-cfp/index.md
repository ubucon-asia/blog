You might already know UbuCon Asia 2025 to be held in Kathmandu, Nepal this year. But what about schedule for call for proposals this year? We got the early news for that today. This year, We'll be opening call for proposals from March. And below is the detailed call for proposals schedule.

- March 1st: Call for proposals begins
- April 2nd: Last day to submit proposals
  - Could be extended few more weeks in case we need to receive more proposals
- April 30th: Sending out proposal review results begins
  - Could be started earlier if we close call for proposals on April 2nd
- May 14th: Last day for content team to send out proposal review results

March 1st sounds like quite far away from now. But it would come pretty sooner than you think. If you plan to submit your session proposals this year, this is actually good timing to start brainstorm about what kind of topic you're gonna choose for your proposal.

We'll be accepting Talks(30min), Workshops(90min), BoF(90min) and Lightning talks(5min) proposals with following topic categories(a.k.a. tracks):

- Desktop and WSL
- Cloud and Infrastructure
- Localizations and Accessibility
- Documentations and QA
- Security and Compliance
- Data, AI and ML
- Devices and IoT
- Content and Design
- Community
- Other
