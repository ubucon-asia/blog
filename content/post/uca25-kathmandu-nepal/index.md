After many discussions within the committee, the UbuCon Asia Committee is glad to announce that UbuCon Asia 2025 will be held in Kathmandu, Nepal. We have only received a bid from Nepal for 2025 and have reached out to other Ubuntu LoCos who might be interested in hosting. The team also had time to improve their bid. After an organizing committee meeting today (November 18th 12:00 UTC) where the Nepal team presented their event organizing plan and answered many committee questions, the UbuCon Asia Committee unanimously agreed to choose Kathmandu, Nepal for UbuCon Asia 2025.

The event will be held at St. Xavier's College (SXC), Kathmandu, Nepal in mid-September during the weekend. Once the venue is confirmed, we will share more event details soon. Hopefully, we'll see everyone in Kathmandu next year!

If you would like to know how we chose Nepal, please check out our bid announcement, bid proposal from Nepal, and video recording of our meeting today:

Bid submissions for 2026 will be due in late March or early April 2025. If you want to host UbuCon Asia 2026 in your city, we recommend starting to prepare your bid today.
